This creates the [scheduling] tag to embed Acuity Scheduling into the page. Usage:
[scheduling site="https://mysite.acuityscheduling.com"]

Options:
site: your scheduling site (required)
width: defaults to 100% (optional)
height: defaults to 600px (optional)

We recommend adding the tag in text mode instead of visual to prevent other formatting of the URL being
inadvertently added. Support is available at http://AcuityScheduling.com/help.php
